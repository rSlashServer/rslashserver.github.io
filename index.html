            <p>
                <strong><u>Jokes, memes or conversations intent on causing harm or discomfort will not be tolerated</u></strong><br/>

                <strong><u>"mini-modding" is not allowed</u></strong><br/>
                <small>
                    This can include telling users to stop spamming, saying a meme isn't allowed, and telling people they aren't old enough<br/>
                    <strong>Ping the mods if needed</strong>, and direct them to the rules
                </small>
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong><u>No flirtatious/sexual conversations or roleplay</u></strong><br/>
                <small>Please keep that to DMs. This also involves any sort of images, gifs or links</small>
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong><u>Keep personal drama out of this server</u></strong><br/>
                <small>If you have issues with a member work it out in DMs, or block them</small>
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong><u>Venting is not tolerated</u></strong><br/>
                <small>We understand you might need to let it out, but this is not the right place to do that</small>

            <h2>Text channels</h2>
            <p>
                <strong><u>No ASCII art</u></strong><br/>
                <small>These are images made with text</small>
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong><u>No media that could trigger epilepsy</u></strong><br/>
                <small>Such as an emote with fast flashing colors</small>
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong><u>Keep messages condensed</u></strong><br/>
                <small>Don't send 10 messages in a row that are 3 words each, it's spam</small>
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong><u>Do not over use emotes in messages or reactions</u></strong><br/>
                <small>It can be annoying to read</small>
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong><u>Keep channels on topic</u></strong><br/>
                <small>For example, rSlash related conversations stay in the rSlash category so they're easy to find</small>
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong><u>Do not farm XP</u></strong><br/>
                <small>Sending messages quickly or contributing nothing to conversations will get you the no-xp role</small>
            </p>
            <br/>
            <h2>Voice channels</h2>
            <p>
                <strong><u>Do not mic spam</u></strong><br/>
                <small>
                    Including heavy breathing, shouting, and unwanted music<br/>
                    This is hard to moderate, and we cannot punish members based on claims<br/>
                    If a moderator is available to join the call they will<br/>
                    Recording is <strong>NOT</strong> recommended due to the different laws in different regions
